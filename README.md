# Autonomous Vehicle Reinforcement Learning using DDPG Algorithm v1.0.0

v0.1 - Working model for model A and model B

v0.2 - Working on model A and model B to the same environment format, where the ddpg actor critic will observe only states 1-3 for model A versus 1-4 for model B

v0.3 - Multi vehicle centralized and decentralized approach

v0.4 - Multi vehicle and multi platoon support w/ inter/intra FRL

v0.5 - Patched reporter for inter/intra FRL experiments, added tunability of critic actor layer
 
v0.6 - Implemented debug api, made improvements to command line interface

v0.7 - Latest in development

v0.8 - weighted fedAvg using gradients

v0.9 - weighted fedavg with gradients or model weights
